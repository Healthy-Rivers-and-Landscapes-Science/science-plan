# Introduction

Parties to the Voluntary Agreements have committed to restoring habitat in 
the Sacramento River watershed (Table 1).

Restored sites will be designed and constructed with water depth and velocity 
criteria over a range of flows that are suitable for target species. Tributary 
sites will be oriented toward salmonids, while Delta sites will address the 
habitat needs of a wider range of native fishes (e.g. delta smelt and longfin 
smelt).

Because of this, habitat accounting in tributaries includes development and/or 
refinement of  flow-habitat area relationships over a range of flows expected at 
restored sites under the flow commitments associated with the Voluntary 
Agreements program and resulting hydrographs. This document discusses the 
flow-habitat area relationships proposed by Voluntary Agreements parties and 
those proposed by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) as related to 
restoration site design, habitat accounting and consistency assessments.



# Documents

There are three documents that address habitat accounting under the Voluntary 
Agreements:

* The [**SWRCB Scientific Basis Report Supplement**](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/docs/2023/staff-report/app-g2.pdf) 
documents the science supporting the proposed provisions included in the 
Voluntary Agreements and was developed by SWRCB staff with the support of 
Department of Water Resources (DWR) and California Department of Fish and 
Wildlife (CDFW) staff

* The [**Draft Voluntary Agreements Strategic Plan Appendix F**](https://resources.ca.gov/-/media/CNRA-Website/Files/Initiatives/Support-Healthy-Rivers-and-Landscape/AppF_HabitatAccountingProtocol.pdf) 
documents a method for non-flow measure (habitat restoration) accounting 
proposed by the parties to the Voluntary Agreements

* The [**SWRCB Draft Program of Implementation**](https://waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/docs/2024/drft-sacdelta-bdplan-updates.pdf) 
provides pathways for implementing that Bay-Delta Water Quality Control 
Plan that incorporate the Voluntary Agreements with amendments recommended by 
SWRCB staff



## SWRCB Scientific Basis Report Supplement

In the Final Scientific Basis Report Supplement, SWRCB staff authors detail an 
approach for estimating and tracking suitable habitat areas for salmonid 
spawning and rearing by linking flow rates to habitat suitability. To develop 
appropriate restoration depth and flow criteria, FlowWest staff and experts 
compiled a dataset of flow-to-habitat relationships for Central Valley 
watersheds, drawn from published studies, and attempted to validate the dataset 
using on-the-ground observations produced by experts working in each watershed 
(Figure 1). 

```{r fig1_hab_suitability_spawning, fig.cap = "Figure 1: Spawning habitat suitability criteria", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("workshop", "figs", "fig1_hab_suitability_spawning.png"))
```

Habitat suitability is measured as weighted usable area per channel length. This 
index, derived from a combination of hydrodynamic modeling and physical habitat 
modeling, assess the impact of depth and velocity on habitat conditions. The 
weighted usable area is calculated using depth and velocity criteria specific to 
each tributary, which are based on observation of fish presence in different 
conditions. The resulting flow-to-suitable-area relationships provide 
time-series data that estimate total suitable habitat as a function of modeled
hydrology for each tributary or, in some cases, tributary reach. 

For each restoration site, flow-habitat curves indicate the potential habitat 
area that meets the suitability standards at different flow rates. This allows 
project planners to estimate how much suitable habitat will be available at the 
design flow (the expected flow rate during salmonid life stages). Project 
outcomes are evaluated based on whether the added habitat area remains within 
suitable criteria across expected flow ranges.

Lastly, it is expected that for rearing habitat, cover features constitute a
minimum of 20% of the total habitat area.



## Draft Voluntary Agreements Strategic Plan Appendix F

Habitat accounting for tributary spawning, in-channel rearing, and tributary 
floodplain rearing habitat enhancement measures accounts for the acreage of
implemented habitat enhancement measures based on design criteria for specific 
projects. Design criteria include water depth and water velocity, as well as 
substrate for spawning measures, and cover for tributary in-channel and 
tributary floodplain rearing measures. 

Habitat accounting is a site-specific assessment that will be conducted at the 
completion of each individual project's construction and will serve as an 
incremental accounting step for whether Voluntary Agreements parties have met 
their non-flow habitat total acreage commitments (Table 1). Site-specific 
assessments must quantify the areas within a project's boundary that conform 
with specific design criteria at design flows, the range of flows over which a 
habitat enhancement project is designed to create habitat. A project's design 
flows may be informed by habitat objectives, habitat features, biological 
objectives, and riverine processes. Flows at which pre-project and as-built 
conditions are compared must be identical.

The design criteria will incorporate water depth and velocity, which includes 
development or refinement of habitat-flow relationships over a range of flows 
reflective of those assumed in the SWRCB Scientific Basis Report 
Supplement for each tributary. Development of new or revised habitat-flow 
relationships will form the basis of a consistency assessment that will compare 
the availability of habitat over the range of applicable flows realized through 
implementation with the assumptions made in the SWRCB Scientific Basis Report 
Supplement. 



### Pre-project characterization

To characterize projects before construction, the project sponsor will:

1. Characterize pre-project physical conditions, including topography, 
substrate, and cover. 
2. Construct a digital elevation model of the project footprint and create  
substrate and cover rasters.
3. Apply two-dimensional hydraulic models to calculate water depths and 
velocities for each computational pixel in the project footprint at each 
modeled flow within the range of design flows.
4. Determine where design criteria (water depth and velocity) are met at each 
modeled flow within the range of design flows for each computational pixel in 
the project footprint using hydraulic (e.g. water depth and velocity) and
non-hydraulic (e.g. substrate) criteria as binary functions. If a computational 
pixel corresponds with the hydraulic and applicable non-hydraulic  
criteria, the pixel is considered to meet design criteria. 
5. Sum the area of all computational pixels in the project's footprint that meet 
design criteria to identify the explicit area (acres) of habitat that meet 
design criteria at each modeled flow in the range of design flows. 

See Figure 2 for a graphical illustration of pre-project characterization. 

```{r fig2_preproject_characterization, fig.cap = "Figure 2: Spawning habitat pre-project characterization", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("workshop", "figs", "fig2_preproject_characterization.png"))
```



### As-built characterization

The process for characterizing projects once built will be the same pre-project 
characterization, including new characterization of physical conditions and the 
development of necessary rasters. 



### Pre-project and as-built differencing

Once the as-built project has been characterized, the pre-project and as-built 
characterizations will be compared to determine the pixels for which additional 
habitat has been constructed (i.e. design criteria are newly met) and the pixels 
for which habitat has been lost (i.e. design criteria were met before the 
project but are no longer met in the as-built project) (Figure 3). This 
comparison will be conducted for all modeled design flows, starting with the 
lowest design flow. The pre-project and as-built comparison will focus 
exclusively on areas newly wetted by each increase in design flow. 

```{r fig3_project_differencing, fig.cap = "Figure 3: Spawning habitat pre-project and as-built comparison", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("workshop", "figs", "fig3_project_differencing.png"))
```

For each tributary rearing habitat enhancement, an area meeting hydraulic 
criteria is counted as rearing habitat only if at least 20% of its area includes 
cover features with a habitat suitability index of at least 0.5. To 
determine the extent of cover, cover features within the project footprint 
should be mapped and then digitized to produce a spatial file (e.g. shapefile) 
(Figure 4). Because juvenile salmonids are typically found within three ft of 
cover elements (see e.g. Moniz and Pasternack 2019 and Hardy et al. 2006), each 
suitable non-cobble cover feature element (e.g. boulders or large woody debris) 
should be buffered by three feet in all directions. Then, the cover spatial file 
should be converted to a raster, where each raster pixel with a centroid that 
falls within the buffered cover spatial file is assigned that cover type.

```{r fig4_cover_raster, fig.cap = "Figure 4: Developing a cover raster", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("workshop", "figs", "fig4_cover_raster.png"))
```

Cover will be evaluated at project completion in accordance with full 
implementation of the project design (e.g. vegetation at maturity). Estimates of 
riparian vegetation area should be species-specific estimates of mature canopy 
size.

If less than 20% of the final, as-built rearing project area has cover, 
quantified using this methodology, no newly constructed habitat is counted.



## SWRCB Draft Program of Implementation 

The SWRCB Draft Program of Implementation for the Bay-Delta Water Quality 
Control Plan specific water depth and velocity design criteria for spawning 
habitat, instream rearing habitat, and tributary floodplain rearing habitat 
(Table 2).

```{r create_design_criteria, echo = FALSE}
poi_design_criteria <- tibble::tribble(
  ~hab_type,              ~depth_ft,    ~velocity_cfs,
  "spawning",             "1.0 to 2.5", "1.0 to 4.0",
  "rearing - instream",   "0.5 to 4.0", "0.0 to 3.0",
  "rearing - floodplain", "0.5 to 4.0", "0.0 to 3.0"
)

poi_col_names <- c("Habitat Type", "Depth (ft)", "Velocity (ft$^3$/sec)")

poi_design_criteria |>
  knitr::kable(
    align = c("l", rep("c", ncol(poi_design_criteria) - 1)),
    col.names = poi_col_names,
    caption = "Table 2: Tributary habitat design criteria"
  ) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    full_width = FALSE, 
    latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position")
  ) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(row = 0, background = mid_grey) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(
    row = seq(from = 1, to = nrow(poi_design_criteria) - 1, by = 2),
    background = light_grey
  )
```

The pre-project and as-built characterization steps in the Draft Program of 
Implementation are functionally equivalent to those in Appendix F, with the 
notable exception that the Draft Program of Implementation specifies that the 
areal extent of a cover feature *should not* be buffered. Additionally, habitat 
verification must occur to confirm that the acreage of habitat meeting design 
criteria across a range of flows conforms with or provides equivalent benefits 
to the flow-habitat relationships provided in the SWRCB Scientific Basis Report 
Supplement (the "assumed flow-habitat relationships"). 

To account for newly constructed habitat, in the final habitat accounting 
assessment, compare the constructed (as-built) flow-habitat relationship to the 
flow-habitat relationships used in the SWRCB Scientific Basis Report Supplement:

1. Within each design flow, add the constructed flow-habitat relationships 
across projects to create an overall constructed flow-habitat relationship for 
each *habitat type* and *tributary or reach*, matching the spatial scale of the 
assumed flow-habitat relationship. 

2. Compare this constructed flow-habitat relationship to the assumed 
flow-habitat relationships
